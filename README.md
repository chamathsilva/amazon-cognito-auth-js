# Promise wrappers for Amazon Cognito Auth SDK 

# Amazon Cognito Auth SDK for JavaScript
You can now use Amazon Cognito Auth to easily add sign-in and sign-out to your mobile and web apps. Your user pool in Amazon Cognito is a fully managed user directory that can scale to hundreds of millions of users, so you don't have to worry about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management and authentication.
